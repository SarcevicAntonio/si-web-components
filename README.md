component specs:

- button with number that increases on click
- number (count) can be set from outside through attribute

general:

- index.html is our entry website

- /native/ contains native HTMLElement-based Web Component implementation

- /svelte/ contains svelte project with svelte based implementation
  - note: build svelte web component using `npm run build` so index.html can import the bundle.js
